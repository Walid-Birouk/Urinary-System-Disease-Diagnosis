# Urinary-System-Disease-Diagnosis app


This GitHub repository hosts an interactive web application designed to help users diagnose urinary system diseases. The app utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of two specific diseases: 
acute inflammation of the urinary bladder and acute nephritis.

Users can input their symptoms, such as body temperature, occurrence of nausea, lumbar pain, urine pushing, micturition pains, and burning of the urethra.

Key Features:

User-friendly web interface for symptom input and diagnosis.
Option to select from three machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Confidence level for each diagnosis.
Accuracy evaluation of the chosen algorithm.
Educational information about the two diseases.
The application provides a valuable tool for individuals seeking preliminary insights into their health conditions. It serves as an educational resource and demonstrates the application of machine learning in the field of healthcare. The codebase and web app can be used as a reference for similar diagnostic applications and as a learning resource for machine learning enthusiasts.
